  Salvador Rodríguez was born and raised in Mexico in his early childhood. When he turned 5 years old, he moved to the United States with his family.
</p>
<p>
 Rodríguez studied Journalism at Arizona State University during the Great Recession in 2008. At the time, he was debating whether to stay in Communications or to
 switch to Business, and follow his father's career footsteps.
</p>
<p>
  However, one day on campus, he overheard his journalism professors. "We really need more business journalists. If we had more business journalists,
  maybe we wouldn't be where we are as a society," they said.
</p>
<p>
  Salvador took this as a calling, and decided to combine his two interests and become a business reporter.
</p>
<p>
  Business journalists <a href="https://www.idem-institute.org/downloads/introductiontobusinessandeconomicjournalism.pdf">track, analyze, and interpret changes in the economy</a>
  to help people make informed decisions on their finances. Business and economic reporters explain the reasoning behind policymaker's decisions,
  why prices for essential items and utilities like food or gas fluctuate; some track the market and explain how the macroeconomic state comes into play to
  help shareholders make informed decisions on what companies to invest in. Money moves and shapes everyone's livelihood.
</p>
<p>
  Salvador Rodríguez took every opportunity he saw to learn how to write these type of stories. Once he graduated, he began to build his career, but it wasn't easy, because
  the area of journalism he is most interested in came with a series of challenges.
</p>
<p>
  The Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism published <a href="https://businessjournalism.org/2022/06/2022salary-survey/">The Business Journalism Salary Survey</a> earlier this year, and, per the results, the respondents were 80.8%
  White, 4.7% Black, 5.5% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 4.7% multiracial.
</p>
<p>
  Hispanics or Latinos are so few that the survey does not even have an independent category for them.
</p>
<p>
  "Usually when I look around on like the business desk, there aren't very many Hispanic journalists around," he described.
</p>
<p>
  José Fernández, Chair of the Economics Department of the University of Louiseville and former president of the American Society of Hispanic Economists,
  highlighted that immigrants have a much higher rate of entrepreneurship than native-born Americans.
</p>
<p>
  According to a study publishd in the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200588">American Economics Review</a>, there are 80% more likely to be "job creators" than "job takers."
</p>
<p>
  "They never tell you that story. So here's a group of people who are more likely to open up a business than a typical American,
  and yet we never hear their story," said Fernández.
</p>
<p>
  "The problem is that you're only going to have one perspective [...] it's important to bring Latinos to have context, because without context,
  there is no journalism and what we do is repeat like a parrot," said Angélica Serrano-Román, a Puerto Rican tax reporter at Bloomberg tax, in Spanish.

<h2>
  Lack of Diversity in newsrooms
</h2>
<p>
  "Without minorities in the newsroom, it's hard for business news organizations to understand economic and job-related stories that affect these populations,"
  said Chris Roush for Talk Biz News.
</p>
<p>
  Newsrooms made it their mission to recruit talent from all sorts of backgrounds in the past few years
  in order to reflect the reality of a diverse America, but it has been deficient.
</p>
<p>
  Systemic issues in society were at the forefront of news coverage
  after murder of George Floyd in Minnesota and the Black Lives Matter protests that overtook the globe. These historic events also
  revealed systemic issues within the media industry.
</p>
<p>
  The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism surveyed over 130 news industry leaders from 38 countries in 2020, and 42%
  of respondents agreed that ethnic diversity was their biggest priority for the next year.
</P>
<iframe title="Biggest priority for 2021" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-kIAcf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kIAcf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="358" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
<p>
  "A more diverse newsroom would help business news organizations find better stories in areas and with subjects where they never
  thought to look," said Chris Roush, professor, business journalist, and author of The Future of Business Journalism for <a href="https://talkingbiznews.com/highlighted-news/the-diversity-problem-in-business-journalism-hurts-coverage/">Talk Biz News</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Latino population is growing exponentially; 98.2 million Hispanics are expected to reside in the US by 2050,
  according to <a href="https://cber.culverhouse.ua.edu/2019/07/26/u-s-population-will-look-different-in-2050/">The University of Alabama Culverhouse College of Business</a>.
</p>
<p>
New generations of Latinos with college education, fluency in English and citizenship will contribute to the U.S. labor force. The journalism industry will need more
  Hispanic reporters who are equipped to write stories about the economy, companies and key financial decision makers that shape people's livelihood.
</p>
<p>
  "Latinx people in this country are more than just crossing a border. We also have bank accounts," said Salvador Rodríguez.
  "We also have financial goals. We also use technology. We can also have our technology exploited and need cybersecurity. We're much more than a border."
</p>
<p>
  Hispanics only make up 3% of news analysts, reporters and journalists, according to data from the Labor Department.
</p>

  The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2022/06/14/journalists-give-industry-mixed-reviews-on-newsroom-diversity-lowest-marks-in-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/">surveyed</a> over 12,000 journalists
  across the country, and 52% say that "their organization does not have enough racial and ethnic diversity."

<h2>
  Toxic Environments for People of Color
</h2>
<p>
  Rodríguez went through a number of career hurdles in his path, but being mistaken for another Hispanic reporter in the office setting stood out.
</p>
<p>
  "That's annoying because it makes you feel like you're just a shade of color, not thought as an
  individual. It's always a reminder that there aren't many of you in the newsroom," he said.
</p>
<p>
  According to a <a href="https://www.nyguild.org/2022-nyt-performance-evaluations-report">report</a> done by members of The News Guild,
  if you are a reporter at The New York Times, you are 61% less likely to receive a high score in annual
  performance evaluations if you identify as a Latino.
</p>
<p>
  Now in his mid thirties, Salvador is better than ever. He secured a great job as a business reporter
  and is based in California.
</p>
<p>
  Another Hispanic journalist attested to the issue-they asked for annonymity in fear of retaliation, so we will call them SF.
</p>
<p>
  They finished their bachelor's degree in 2014, and soon after, entered the workforce. Up until 2018, they were always on a temporary contract
   as an associate producer for NPR.
</p>
<p>
  "It was a really hard place for Latinos and other people of color. It was tough on my self-esteem at a lot of points," said SF.
   "I didn't feel that I was valued, despite working there for years but never being able to reach a permanent contract."
</p>
<p>
  There were many coworkers who were on the same temporary contract cycle during their time at the company.
</p>
<p>
  After five years in the industry, they decided to go back to school to acquire the foundations in journalism and gain mobility in their career.
</p>
<h2>
  Poor Retention Rate
</h2>
<p>
  Furthermore, the retention rate within newsrooms has long been a palpable issue in the journalism industry.
</p>
<p>
  "I think that one thing is hiring people from other communities and another thing is retaining them," said SF.
</p>
<p>
  Cardiff García, co-founder and former host of the podcast The Indicator, observed this issue during his time from the
  podcasting realm of NPR.
</p>
<p>
  "Why not just hire for the full-time position? If you've got a need for somebody to do different kinds of work [...] why
  not just advertise that as a full-time position and hire somebody," said García.
</P>
<p>
  The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/at-npr-an-army-of-temps-resents-a-workplace-full-of-anxiety-and-insecurity/2018/12/07/32e49632-f35b-11e8-80d0-f7e1948d55f4_story.html">reported</a>
  on this issue in 2018, and NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2018/12/21/679173239/temporary-employees-long-term-impact">released</a>
  a public statement shortly after.
</p>
<h2>
  Master's Degrees Help Pave A Career Path
</h2>

  <p>
  "The percentage of Latinos that have a master's in journalism in this country, it's so small," said SF.
  "There are just so few of us who are in this profession."
</p>
<p>
  Not only did their graduate degree prepare them for the industry with reporting and writing skills, it also
  provided SF networking opportunities and connections, all of which they use in their daily life.
</p>
<p>
  SF finished their master's program in December 2020, making them part of the 20% of the U.S. Hispanic adults with a bachelor's degree
  or higher in 2021, up from 13% in 2010, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/23/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/">study</a> conducted by the Pew Research Center.
</p>
<p>
  SF applied to the program with a different concentration in mind. However, after attending an orientation about the business concentration,
  they changed their mind and decided to give business reporting a shot.
</p>
<p>
  "I wouldn't have imagined myself to be a business journalist if I hadn't had this opportunity," they said.
</p>
<p>
  Cardiff García himself had no connection to the journalism industry; he graduated college with a degree in Finance and Accounting,
  and worked as an analyst at JP Morgan for three years.
</p>
<p>
  He wrote for the company's internal newsletter read by analysts at the bank; after his first contact with writing and editing,
  he decided to go back to school to learn more. He earned his M.S. in Journalism from Columbia University and was eventually hired
  at the Dow Jones Financial News. He worked there for 2 and half years.
</p>
<p>
  Angélica Serrano-Román worked as a freelance reporter during her undergraduate studies at la Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in
  Santurce, Puerto Rico. She originally chose journalism because it was an industry where she could write stories about any topic,
  from education to politics. However, things changed after Hurricane María struck the island of Puerto Rico in 2017.
</p>
<p>
  She noticed that much of the public discourse post-María revolved around how the government was "leading the commonwealth to an economic recovery."
</p>
<p>
  Serrano-Román debunked the misleading information through her skills in data journalism and fact-checking for the Puerto Rico's Center of Investigative journalism
  (CPI, in Spanish). This event was a turning point in her career.
</p>
<p>
  "I [realized] I should combine economic journalism with my background in data and investigative journalism and work on this because,
  in reality, there are very few journalists in Puerto Rico who are versed in the area," said Serrano-Román.
</p>
<p>
  A year later, she was accepting at New York University's Master's Program in Economic and Business Journalism, where she was the only
  Latina in a cohort of 8 people, like the graduating class before her. The year after she graduated, there was, again, only one Latina
  enrolled in the program.
</p>
<p>
  At her fellowship in the investigative unit in CNBC, she was the only Latina in a team of four people, and she remains as the sole
  Latina reporter employed at Bloomberg Tax.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, Angélica underscored that the issue is rooted beyond the employee recruitment in media companies. It's rooted in the access to education.
</p>
<p>
  "We also have to understand that not many people graduate or have the access to the education to be able to get these jobs.
  So you're competing with people who have [prestigious] education that not everyone has access to. It's something that starts from
  access to education and access to opportunity [...] So it's a systemic problem," said Serrano-Román.
</p>
<p>
  In 2021, over 100,000 degrees in journalism were awarded from post secondary institutions; 16%, or over 19,000, were awarded to Hispanic graduates.

<p>
  Macarena Carrisoza, a video journalist from Paraguay at Bloomberg Industry,
  believes that diversity is valuable within the team, where the way you portray people and stories matter.
</p>
<p>
Carrisoza was a career changer as well. With a background in business administration and video production, she applied to journalism school to learn how to break down complex things into simpler ways.
</p>
<p>
  She found that the Business and Economic Reporting concentration at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism gave her the techniques she needed.
</p>
<p>
  "It just seemed really intimidating to be able to report on certain things [...] like the stock market. I was intrigued by the challenge," said Macarena Carrisoza.
</p>
<p>
  However, her ultimate goal was to become a video journalist-and that she became. She's been at Bloomberg Industry as a video reporter ever since she graduated.
</p>
<h2>
  What Latino and Hispanic Reporters Bring to the Reporting
</h2>
<p>
  For a <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/top-twenty-tax-myths-and-why-theyre-wrong-part-2">video</a> about tax myths, she thought it would be important to mention that undocumented immigrants
  pay taxes, but don't recieve the benefits. When they are hired, they are put on payroll and their taxes are withheld.
  However, at the end of the year, when everyone else gets their withholding statement from their employer, they don't. Therefore, cannot file for tax returns.
</p>
<p>
  "My team was supportive and we included it. So little things like that I will always advocate to include. I'm not doing a video about immigration. but I always do try to have awareness about
  social realities," said Carrisoza.
</p>
<p>
  "They're the ones that are partaking the most in the idea of the American. They've left somewhere else to start anew and
  participate in the economy. Undocumented people come here to work, they pay their taxes, but they don't get their returns.
  They're still contributing to the economy," said José Fernández.
</p>
<p>
  Angélica flagged a similar angle that would not have received the same amount of attention had she not been there.
</p>
<p>
  The government of Puerto Rico passed Act 52 to replace Act 54 earlier this year, and the IRS issued a tight deadline for companies
  on the island to amend their tax decrees to continue benefiting from a foreign tax credit.
</p>
<p>
  Although it was a federal issue, Angélica saw an urgency to include Puerto Rico in the narrative because "15% of the economy of Puerto Rico
  depends on what was Law 54," she said. "We had to interview people in Puerto Rico."
</p>
<p>
  This story was developed in mid September of 2022, when Hurricane Fiona was approaching the island. Serrano's teammates were unsure of the
  possibility of gathering sources on the island on time.
</p>
<p>
  "I was just going to make the attempt because I know it's such an important issue for people, even if a hurricane is outside,
  they're going to answer the phone," she said.
</p>
<p>
  And they did. Angélica diversified her reporting by interviewing two accountants from Puerto Rico; she delivered a well rounded
  <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/companies-in-puerto-rico-face-deadline-on-us-foreign-tax-credit?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=9D2F4028-3934-11ED-8539-59BE4F017A06&utm_medium=taxdesk">story</a>
  for Bloomberg Tax.
</p>
<p>
  José Fernández hardly ever speaks with Hispanic reporters about economic sectors and industries-he could only mention off the
  top of his head two Hispanic reporters he's spoken to in his career, one of which is in this story: Cardiff García.
</p>
<p>
  When Cardiff was at The Indicator, he produced a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/26/960884670/the-hispanic-economic-outlook">story</a> on the Hispanic Economic Outlook, a report published every year by the
  American Society of Hispanic Economists. He got in touch with the presidents at the time, who happened to be Fernández, to talk about the report.
</p>
<p>
  "It's important to speak with Hispanic economists about the Hispanic Economic Outlook, but you also need to be speaking with Hispanic
  economists about issues that don't have anything to do with Latinos in the economy because they're doing other great work," said García.
</p>
<p>
  García, throughout his career, would consistently revisit the economics of immigration as a topic, and believes it isn't a coincidence.
</p>
<p>
  Like many children of immigrants, Cardiff was born and raised in a multigenerational household full of Cubans, and throughout his life,
  García became interested in how immigrants reflect their resiliency in different ways.
</p>
<p>
  "A Latino family, or more specifically a Cuban family, there's all kinds of ideological diversity, which I think is helpful as a journalist [...]
  In my family, there's super lefties and there's super conservatives," he said.
</p>
<p>
  García described how occasionally he would talk about his family's varied political spectrum to another reporter and would be asked how he would deal with it.
</p>
<p>
  "I deal with it the same way everybody else deals with family, you know, we care for each other and sometime we fight like crazy
  and then we make up. That's how family works [...] I think it's helpful to come from a big, loud, very opiniated family."
 <p>
   Fran Velasquez, a writer and reporter at CoinDesk originally from Atlanta, Georgia, also brings his culture to the newsroom.
 </p>
 <p>
   He explained that his persistence to prove others that he is qualified made him a stronger writer.
 </p>
 <p>
   "I remind people that yes, I am Latino, but I am also a journalist, I can do the work just as well as any other person," said
   Velasquez in the NAHJ Newmark Alumni Panel on October 24.
 </p>
 <p>
   As a Hispanic reporter, he pitched that he could "write stories in English and translate them in
   Spanish" because he knew he could bring his language skills to the newsroom.
   He now writes for CoinDesk En Español, where they will focus on the economy of Brazil, Argentina and general South America.
 </p>
 <p>
   "I will be writing for that, but, I think, from your culture, other stories can emerge, and other connections can come," said Fran Velasquez.
</p>
<h2>
  Call to Action
</h2>
<p>
  During Cardiff's time at The Indicator, he would cover issues on racial and economic inequality from
  time to time with his co-anchor Stacy Vanek Smith.
</p>
<p>
  Back in the Great Recession, one of which that caught many economists by surprise, a key historical
  indicator was overlooked.
</p>
<p>
  There was a rise of unemployment for Black workers early on, and the rate was rising at a faster pace than
  for everybody else. Historically that's been a signal that something's going wrong, said García.
</p>
<p>
  Cardiff made it clear that you don't need to be a Black economist to see the rising unemployment rate within
  the Black population of workers, but if you happen to be a Black economist, there's a good chance that you'll be
  more interested in what's also happening to the people from your background.
</p>
<p>
  "If you have a diverse newsroom, you'll find things that a homogenous newsroom won't," he highlighted. "If you want
  to find really good stories that might tell something bigger about society or about the economy, then its a great thing
  to have people from a diversity of backgrounds."
</p>
<p>
  Before closing off the conversation, Cardiff echoed Angélica Serrano-Román on the thought of recruitment; it must be done in the right
  spirit, not "hire a Latino person because that's what's missing in the newsroom," he said.
</p>
<p>
  "It's not like you're going to have a Puerto Rican, for example, in the newsroom and be able to say you cover Puerto Ricans in general
  because there are different kinds of Puerto Ricans: those who are from the island and live there, those that had to leave, those born here [in the US].
  Yes, diversify [reporters], but understanding the needs of each group," said Serrano-Román.
</p>
<p>
  "This has to be a systemic fix [...] we need to make sure that we have the right hiring processes in place [...] There's still a lot of
  work to still be done in terms of how to end up with newsrooms that reflect the country and not just people who end up getting super fancy
  college degrees," said García.
</p>
